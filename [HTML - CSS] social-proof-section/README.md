## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I used CSS Flexbox for mobile design and CSS Grid for desktop design and I did not have any complications.

I think I applied well background images since I learned it on a previous challenge. 

I am not sure about the overall size, since I did not used Figma design.

If you have any suggestions to improve my code, please feel free to comment!
