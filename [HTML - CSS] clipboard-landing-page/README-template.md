## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS animations


### What I learned

I really enjoyed making this landing page. I tried to use most semantic HTML and tried to keep it clean. However, mi CSS could be improved since I repeated styles in many sections, so I think I should join those.
I wanted to make something different and tried to practice my CSS animation skills by making a "marquee" animation with the section of the companies images.
Feel free to leave me your opinion about this and my code!
