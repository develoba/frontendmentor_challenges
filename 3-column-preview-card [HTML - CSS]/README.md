## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I did not have any main issues to code this challenge. I practiced the use of pseudo classes in this challenge.
For this, I used pseudo element ::before to add the icon of each card, and I used pseudo elements to select each card and apply separated styles.

However, I tried to keep clean CSS rules and repeat styles as little as possible. Please leave any comment to improve my code!
