## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Absolute positioning

### What I learned

Very fun challenge! I used absolute positioning and ::after and ::before pseudoelements to make the progress bar. Can it be done in a better way and more responsive?

For the rest of the challenge, I simply used flexbox to align elements.

Feel free to comment about my code or any improvement that can be made!
