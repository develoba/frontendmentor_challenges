## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive images

### What I learned

The most difficult part for me was to make the image responsive for different screen size. 
After looking how to do it and after reading some code of other developers I made it; however, I am not sure which is the best way to do that.

Feel free to make any suggestions about this or other parts of my code!
