## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I practiced more on my JS skills and learned how to remove the active classes when another button is clicked.

I don't have any question about this challenge; however, I know I need improvement on my CSS structure and resposiveness, as well as improving my scripts. Feel free to leave any advice!
