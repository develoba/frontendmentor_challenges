## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced the use of CSS grid for the three elements of the card. When the view is for mobile, I didn't applied grid, since the three elements are in cascade. However, when the size is for tablet and desktop, the grid applies and the first element takes the full row.

I didn't find any complications on coding this card. However, if you think the code could be improved, feel free to leave a comment!
