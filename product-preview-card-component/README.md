### What I learned

Firstly, I used semantic HTML5, wrapping the card in a main tag, in which there is an article element to define the text part of the card. 

For the image, since there are two different images for mobile and desktop, I added both images in CSS as a background image in a responsive way, using @media-queries. Moreover, I applied BEM methodology for all elements. 

Regarding CSS, the new properties I practiced were grid and flexbox. I also practiced to use the pseudoclass ::before to add the icon cart instead of adding it on HTML.

Hope you enjoy this solution!
