## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

It is quite a simple project; however, I found myself struggling with the change of active states between desktop size and mobile. I think it could be improved with a better structure on my html tag's classes.

Feel free to give me any advice on my code, I would really appreciate! 

Happy coding!
